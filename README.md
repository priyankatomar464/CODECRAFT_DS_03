# CODECRAFT_DS_03: Bank Marketing - Decision Tree Classifier

This project builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on their demographic and behavioral data.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used

- **Source**: [Bank Marketing Dataset - UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
- **File**: `bank.csv` (semicolon-separated)
- Contains attributes like age, job, marital status, education, balance, duration, etc.
- Target variable: `y` â†’ 'yes' or 'no' (subscription)

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

Use decision tree classification to predict customer subscription likelihood and explore which features impact the decision most.

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Tasks Performed

- Data preprocessing and encoding categorical variables
- Train/test split (80/20)
- Model training using `DecisionTreeClassifier`
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualizing the decision tree structure

---

## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Tree Visualization using `plot_tree()`
